internal calculations:  
AL1 = Hc * Mu;
AL2 = Mg * Hi;
AL3 = P * R;
AL4 = Mg * Me;
AL5 = Mai * Mai / Hi;
AL6 = Mu * Mc;
AL7 = Mg / Mc;
AL8 = Ml * Ml / Hi;
AL9 = Cm * Cm / Hi;
AL10 = Mcx * Bh;
AL11 = Mrd * Bh;
AL12 = Ht * Hi * Mrr;
AL13 = Mmd / Hi;

output: 
A_total = (AL1 + AL2 + AL7 + AL10 + AL11 + AL12 + AL13 + AL5 + AL8 + AL9 + AL3*AL4 + AL5*AL6) / z;
